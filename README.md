Welcome to the golem-nlp-workshop repository! This repository contains resources and code samples related to essential Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and tools.

  

## Key Topics Covered

- **TF-IDF**: A text representation that assigns importance to words based on their frequency in a document and across a corpus.

- **Stop Words**: Removing common words that do not contribute to the meaning of a text.

- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base form, taking into account their morphological structure.

- **Entity Recognition**: Extracting named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations, from text.

- **Word2Vec**: An unsupervised learning technique for generating continuous word embeddings.

- **BERT**: A powerful pre-trained language model used for various NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and question-answering.

  

## Getting Started


Google Colab is a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that offers free GPU and TPU resources for machine learning projects. To open the notebooks from the `golem-nlp-workshop` repository in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1.  Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Click on the `File` menu in the top left corner and select `Open notebook...`.
4.  In the `Open a notebook` window, switch to the `GitHub` tab.
5.  Enter the repository URL `https://github.com/yourusername/golem-nlp-workshop` in the search bar and press Enter.
6.  You will see a list of notebooks from the repository. Click on the desired notebook to open it in a new Colab instance.
7.  Once the notebook is loaded, you can run cells and modify the code as needed.

If you want to save your changes, you can either save a copy of the notebook to your Google Drive or download it to your local machine using the `File` menu.
